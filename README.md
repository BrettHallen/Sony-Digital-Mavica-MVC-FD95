## [PlayMemories Home](https://support.d-imaging.sony.co.jp/www/disoft/int/playmemories-home/en/)
This is Sony's software for managing photos and videos - downloads (as of Jan 2026) are still available for 32bit Windows and Mac (10.14 or lower) with the 64bit Windows version still kind-of maintained it seems:<br>

<ins>Notice for end of download availability of PlayMemories Home</ins>
- Downloads of PlayMemories Home Ver. 5.5 (version for 32-bit operating systems) were ended on March 31, 2020.
- The download service for the Mac version of PlayMemories Home was scheduled to be terminated on March 31, 2020. However, the period has been extended, and downloads are still available.
- The Windows 64-bit version of PlayMemories Home will continue to be available for download.
- If you update macOS to 10.15, you will not be able to use PlayMemories Home anymore.

This software was probably very useful originally for importing images from Memory Stick via the RS232 serial port adapator, but not really sure what the point of the software is these days when you can just drag/drop files from whatever media.  I'll give it a try on my Mac though.<br>
